      p The MalJusT Template was developed as a way to provide management system<br> developers a skeleton structure that consists of some of the most common features <br> that are included in most online management systems. This is a full stack template <br> that consists of a diverse set of features in the front-end and a back-end that<br> connects to distributed database. Considering that there various templates <br> available online differing only in frameworks and look & feel(design), intended <br> organizations that will benefit most from this particular template are the ones <br> willing and interested in implementing the business logic behind the distributed <br> database logic.
