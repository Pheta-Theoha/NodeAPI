            p(id="p1").
                The Voting System Template can be used as a voting platform in any case where a group decision or user input is required as a 
                to learn about their preferences. <br>Its main advantage is reaching a broad class of users when it is implemeted by a big enough
                organization.<br> This does not mean it wouldn't be advantageous or useful to small organizations, size is just an added benefit 
                that bigger organizations can take advantage of. Its core advantage remains being on standby to be used on occations such as<br> 
                nominations of employee of the year in an organization with different departments.

            p(id="p2").
                Since our home country is proving to be a rising tourist attraction within the Southern African nations, there seems 
                a need in the market for a management system.<br> <br>For the apparent reasons that the ministry of travel and tourism
                will simply provide no time to design and implemente any management system due to being used to do things the old way.
                behind its functionality. <br>Due to the limited resources this country has,
                builing a management system might not make it to the top  
                of the priority list, but it might be rented or bought.

            h1(class="welcome") Hospitality System
            p(id="p1").
                The Hospitality management system is specifically designed to store patient information in a hospital, considering 
                that hopitals have more pressing <br>patient matters than designing a management system, this template is free to use 
                for all the health care NGOs and government funded or public hospitals. Profit was not an incentive for designing this
                template as it is going to benefit everyone once it is implemented.<br> As for private hospitals, a minor fee will be charged<br> 
                to cover the basic maintenance costs. This was designed with an altruistic motive putting profit aside.<br>

            h1(class="welcome") Student Registration
            p(id="p2").
                This template is very desparately needed in most of the national academic institudes, especially Lerotholi 
                Polytechnic (spoken from experience). The old ways simply don't work best anymore.<br> <br>Office administrators 
                at this various institudes might better suited to explain why such a template is in need. As more registration 
                processes are being digitized, student registration should be no exception. <br>The database structure is broken 
                down into various nodes, which will free any institution from purchasing storage servers or paying for cloud services.
